## How to test

Even though you can access the data at the link "http://localhost:3000/api/books", you can't make any changes to the database, you need an **API TESTER** to do that, such as [**POSTMAN**](https://www.postman.com/). Simply create an account and a project, then you are finally ready for testing each route and messing with the database, speaking of routes, we can now go to the next topic. 

## API Routes
